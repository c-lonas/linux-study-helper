## Getting Started

This web application is a study aid for the Linux Essentials Exam by the LPI. Currently the project has flashcards for module 1.1, with additional modules planned to be added in the future

It is a React project built with strict Typescript using the Next.js web development framework and deployed to Vercel. I use the Framer Motion libary to handle the animations.

This project also includes an open API containing the data set I created with LPI's study resources for the flash cards.
